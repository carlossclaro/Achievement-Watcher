You need a Steam Web API key for the app to be able to fetch data from Steam.<br />
You can acquire one [by filling out this form](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).<br />
Enter your key in `Settings > Advanced`.**

A sexy achievement file parser with real-time notification, automatic screenshot and playtime tracking.<br />
View every achievement earned on your PC whether it's coming from Steam, a Steam emulator, and more.<br />
To see the full list of what this app can import please see the [**Wiki/Compatibility**](https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher/wiki/Compatibility).

The original idea behind this app was that some steam emulators generate a text file where your unlocked achievements are stored. 
But they aren't very friendly to know which is which, here is an example :
```ini
[NEW_ACHIEVEMENT_1_1]
Achieved=1
CurProgress=0
MaxProgress=0
UnlockTime=0000000000
[SteamAchievements]
00000=NEW_ACHIEVEMENT_1_1
Count=1
```
So which achievement is NEW_ACHIEVEMENT_1_1 ? You'll have to ask the steam API or look online in a site like the steamdb to find out.
So let's just do that automagically :)

Notification on achievement unlocking
==========================================

Not as sexy as a directX Overlay but it's the next best thing.<br />
Display a notification when you unlock an achievement via<br />
- [Toast notification](https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher/wiki/Toast-notification) (Windows 8 / 10)
- [Websocket](https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher/wiki/Websocket-Notification-'API') (Usage example: Twitch overlay) 
- [GNTP (Growl)](https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher/wiki/GNTP-(Growl-Notification-Transport-Protocol)) (Recommended for Windows 7)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Please verify your system settings for this to work properly**. [More info](https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher/wiki/Toast-notification#windows-settings)<br />
You can test notification in Settings > Debug to make sure your system is correctly configured or seems to be.<br />
There is a lot of things to check so make sure to have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher/wiki/Notification-%22Not-Working%22) before asking for help.

üì∏ If you have enabled the *souvenir* option(s) then a screenshot and/or video will be taken when you unlock an achievement.<br />

üìñ Wiki and troubleshoot
========================

There is a lot to say about this app. So for more info, configuration, troubleshoot, common issues etc ...<br />
Please kindly see the [Wiki](https://github.com/xan105/Achievement-Watcher/wiki), thank you.

Translation Help
================

I do my best to translate everything for every supported language by Steam, but it's rather difficult and I don't speak that much languages.<br />
Fluent in another language ? Any help to add/modify/improve would be greatly appreciated.

More details [here](https://github.com/xan105/achievement-watcher/tree/1.x/app/locale)

How to build
============

### Prequisites:

You will need Node.js 14.x in x64 with NPM installed.<br/>
Innosetup 5 unicode with preprocessor and [Inno Download Plugin](https://mitrichsoftware.wordpress.com/inno-setup-tools/inno-download-plugin/) (building the setup)<br/>

For Node.js you globally need asar and json :<br/>
```
npm install -g asar json
```

There will be some native_module to compile so you'll need :<br/>
VS2017 / C++ build tools, Python ~2.7~ 3.x (node-gyp), and the Windows SDK **10.0.17134.0** (1803 Redstone 4)

### Build:

Install `node_modules` folders with `npm install.cmd`<br/>
or do it yourself with `npm ci` in `/app`, `/service/updater` and `/service/watchdog`.<br/>
Use `buildme.cmd` in the root folder to build.

### Notes: 

+ Most of the native code is now shipped as prebuilt binaries. If you want to compile them yourself I invite you to check out their corresponding repo.<br/>
NB: Golang cgo requires a gcc compiler installed and set in PATH (recommended : http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download).

+ Innosetup is expected to be installed in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 5` if that is not the case then update `buildme.cmd` with the correct path.

+ If NPM gives you some trouble, try to delete every `package-lock.json`.
